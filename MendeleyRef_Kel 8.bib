abstract = {Saat ini telah dikembangkan federated SPARQL query engine yang mempunyai kemampuan untuk melakukan query dari beberapa SPARQL endpoint yang terdistribusi, sehingga data yang berasal berbagai sumber memungkinkan untuk diperoleh. Ketika dijalankan untuk melakukan query, masing-masing query engine mempunyai kinerja yang berbeda-beda. Salah satu faktor yang berpengaruh terhadap kinerja dari query engine adalah karakteristik dari dataset RDF yang diakses, seperti jumlah triple, kelas, property, subjek, entity, objek, dan spreading factor dataset. Tugas Akhir ini dilakukan untuk mengidentifikasi karakteristik dataset RDF serta mengetahui karakteristik dataset yang berpengaruh terhadap kinerja dari query engine. Penelitian dilakukan dengan mengidentifikasi 10 dataset yang diambil dari jurnal penelitian lain. Sedangkan uji coba untuk mengetahui keterkaitan antara karakteristik dataset dengan kinerja dari query engine dilakukan menggunakan federated SPARQL query engine FedX. Dari hasil analisis, diketahui bahwa jumlah triple dan jumlah kelas yang terkait dengan query cenderung berpengaruh terhadap kinerja dari query engine. Sedangkan jumlah property yang terkait dengan dataset, spreading factor dataset, dan spreading factor dataset yang terkait dengan query cenderung tidak berpengaruh terhadap kinerja dari query engine.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

abstract = {Node centrality has been widely studied in the complex networks. In 2010, the model of node centrality under the weighted network was obtained by Tore Opashl et al. Tie weights and the number of ties were connected with certain proportion by tuning parameter in the model. However, the proportion is random measure. In this paper, the selection standard of the optimal turning parameters is proposed. In the proposed method, the maximum degree centrality of node can be emphasized. The numerical example of weighted network on optimal value selection is used to show the efficiency of the method {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The index is based on the degrees of the vertices in a given undirected graph, and it will enlarge the class of comparable graphs with respect to a centrality measure.

abstract = {Network formed between users in a social media can be used to encourage information spreading among them. This research applied Social Network Analysis which further can be used to social media marketing to improve the marketing process effectively. Based on previous research, information spreading speed among the social media is affected by the users' activity connection which can be represented in centrality value. The centrality value itself is very affected by the graph structure and weights. This research applied degree and eigenvector centrality to observe the effect of centrality value for twitter data. The result shows that there is significant difference among 10 most influential users. This result will be used for the future research that will be focused in small and medium enterprise (SME) twitter data.},
